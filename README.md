## Info

This is reasearch project to support [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) community.
Based on awesome [torstatus.rueckgr.at](https://torstatus.rueckgr.at/) and source codes [paulchen/torstatus](https://github.com/paulchen/torstatus). Thank you.

## Usage

Feel free to clone this project and run your own version.

**Requirements**

- VPS
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make

**Installation**

1. Setup Docker Compose stack.

  - Take a look at our prepared `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Feel free to edit DB credentials.
  - Torstatus configuration is located at `./torstatus/web/config.php`.

2. Initialize app structure.

  - Create data and confif folders (`./_data` & `./_config` by default).
  - Setup permissions for Tor.

  ```
  make init
  ```

3. Configure your Tor node.

  - Make a copy of `./docker/tor/torrc` file to configure your own Tor node (name, ip, contact, limits, etc).

  ```
  cp ./docker/tor/torrc ./_config/torrc
  ```

4. Start Docker Compose stack.

  ```
  # Recommended for the first time
  docker-compose up

  # Later
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

5. Import SQL data.

  - Once MySQL is fully loaded, import tables and first records.

  ```
  make db-init
  ```

6. Retrive Tor data.

  - You need to fetch data from your Tor node.
  - Run perl script located in `./torstatus/tns_update.pl`.

  ```
  make update
  ```

  - It might take a while for the first time.

7. Open `http://IP:8000`.
