TorStatus - Tor Network Status

You may download the most current version at:
http://project.torstatus.kgprog.com/

To setup TorStatus:

a) Database
	1) Create a MySQL database
	2) Add the table structures from 'install.sql'
	3) You may choose any database name you wish to use, however
	   be sure to reflect the changes into the 'web/config.php' file.
b) Web Server (example virtual host configuration file: install.apache2)
	1) You need a web server set up (Apache recommended), which must
	   support GD and PHP, and for the modern graphs must support
	   Perl through CGI.
	2) Set the folder 'web' as the document root for your virtual host
	   or web server, and the folder 'cgi-bin' as your cgi folder.
	3) Enable compression for the web directory in Apache
c) Local Tor Server
	1) Make sure you have a local Tor server running
	   a) Your Tor server needs to be version 0.2.0.6-alpha or higher!
	2) You need to add 'ControlPort PORTNUMBER' to your Tor config file.
	3) You need to add 'DownloadExtraInfo 1' to your Tor config file for
	   banwidth graphs to work correctly.
	4) Set the cgi-bin directory of your webserver to TorStatus'
	   cgi-bin directory. (For Perl-based graphs)
d) Configure TorStatus
	1) You may find the full list of configuration options in README.
	2) You must copy 'web/config_template.php' to 'web/config.php'
	3) You must set:
		$LocalTorServerIP
		$LocalTorServerControlPort
		$SQL_Server
		$SQL_User
		$SQL_Pass
		$SQL_Catalog (means SQL database)
		$TNS_Path (leaving trailing slash)
		$myMirrorName
	4) Test your setup by running './tns_update.pl' or 
	   'perl tns_update.pl'.  If no errors occur after several minutes,
	   then things should be setup correctly.  Also browse to your website
	   and make sure everything looks like it is working.
e) Configure the daemon
	1) Run 'tns_update.pl'.  (To run it in the background, run 
	   './tns_update.pl &')

TorStatus should now be set up!  You can test this by going to your TorStatus
mirror website!
