It is strongly recommend to upgrade to version 4.0 through a clean install.
The database structure has not changed much, so if you want to keep TorStatus
running during the install period, then you can just add the Bandwidth and
Mirrors table to the database.

----

To upgrade to TorStatus v3.6 or higher from any previous versions, you need 
to make sure that you are using Tor 0.2.0.6-alpha or later.  This is due to
proposal 104 to Tor, which uses smaller descriptors by default.

You may view more in ticket 40 at http://project.torstatus.kgprog.com/

You also need to set the option "DownloadExtraInfo 1" in your Tor
configuration.
